# UIC-Bank-v2.0
Project Description:
  The goal for the v2.0 of the UIC Bank project is to extend the banking program I originally created to support N (any number) of bank accounts.
  In v2.0 I'm going to support any number of bank accounts, along with the ability to add, subtract, and get certain information from specified accounts and balances.
  Specifically I'll be making use of dynamically-allocated arrays for storing and manipulating the bank data.
  In part 01, I’ll introduce arrays and update the interactive loop accordingly.
  In part 02, I’ll be focusing on the dynamic aspect of the arrays and adding support for adding, deleting, and merging accounts.
